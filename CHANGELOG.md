# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add a per-player Modern **Ground movement** setting (Advanced settings ›
  Movement). Newly saved Modern profiles use schema 8; older versions reject
  them and require separate profiles. Earlier profiles load as Run toward input.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-10-22

- Prevent scenery from interpolating through cinematic camera cuts when a distant
  shape incorrectly anchors the shared transform. Tawfret chief camera changes
  passed owner review at 120 FPS with logging off.

- Prevent cinematic camera-helper models from appearing as floating squares.
  This corrects an original-game artifact while retaining camera paths and
  scene state. Owner verified all three Tawfret chief shots at 120 FPS with
  diagnostics and FPS logging disabled. See the
  [investigation write-up](docs/development/tawfret-camera-helper-findings-2026-10-22.md).

- Enable independent Modern controls for P1-P4 and correct Floyd co-op/mission
  fire routing, vertical direction and controller diagonal reach.
- Add mouse-steered Floyd flight with W thrust, S brake and A/D strafe, plus a
  separate controller flight-inversion option. Floyd changes are owner-approved
  locally; ask the original reporter to verify the delivered version.
- Prevent mixed wall/height collision corrections from collapsing the Modern
  mouse camera against the character.
- Smooth Quarry day/night fog-distance steps while retaining original cycle
  timing and colours; restore consistent tribal brightness.
- Complete the owner-reviewed cutscene skip batch, preserving native completion
  behavior. Keep unsafe/debug-only scene-selector entries out of normal gameplay;
  their diagnostic limitations remain documented.
- Process Give weapons requests safely while the Mods window pauses gameplay,
  and show actual grant acknowledgement instead of submission-only feedback.
- Refresh Live map Mods with separate toggles/actions, status feedback, accessible
  disabled/focus states and scalable local icon artwork.
- Show progress while verifying game files in both launcher surfaces.
- Add a conventional window-swapchain fallback when DirectComposition setup
  fails. Windows checks pass; Steam Deck/Proton verification still needs the reporter.
- Include bounded mouse input diagnostics in support reports for #32; this is
  evidence collection, not a claimed fix for intermittent mouse input.
- Update community credits and release documentation.

- Preserve Modern swimming camera orientation and native collision clearance,
  including overhead views. Keep native body facing through water-origin jumps
  to avoid snapping on surface departures and re-entry; owner-approved locally.

- Restore the original boss aiming range for Modern mouse and controllers,
  including both Mizar encounters. All five boss fixtures match EmuHawk in
  automated angle checks; owner-approved after live Twin Mantis review.

- Default Modern mouse vertical inversion to Off for new profiles and resets.
  Preserve existing saved choices and controller settings. This does not
  resolve the separate intermittent mouse-look/ineffective-Off report (#32).

- Restore Modern crouch/prone side rolls and correct backward-crawl reversal
  and diagonal motion during prone rolls. Preserve native roll speed and easing.
- Add bindable Roll Left/Right actions for Modern keyboard/mouse and controllers,
  plus an Advanced automatic movement rolling switch shared per player.
  New roll bindings default to unbound; automatic rolling remains enabled.
- Preserve removed-controller exclusions when changing input type and refresh
  idle P1-P4 indicators after saved controller changes. Owner preview review passed.
  Newly saved Modern profiles use schema 7; older versions require separate profiles.


- Prevent chopped sound-effect fragments while skipping Vela's rescue by omitting
  effect starts from intermediate shots in a confirmed skip chain. Preserve
  native cleanup, music and normal playback. Owner listening review passed.
- Clear launcher menu hover when entering the game while preserving dropdown
  selection across the child input window. Native UI checks and owner review passed.

- Show rain through supported room-entry fades instead of waiting for the fade
  to finish. Preserve fade masking and native gating for unsupported cases.
  Native/regression checks and owner visual review passed; reporter retest remains.

- Prevent depth-buffer readback from appearing as white/rainbow geometry in
  interpolated character-selection frames after the Vela/SS Anubis cinematics.
  Renderer regression checks and owner visual verification passed.
- Add an in-game cutscene skip prompt: A, B or Start reveals it; hold A for one
  second to confirm. Reviewed cinematics use explicit native completion and
  scene transitions, preserving progression and required music changes.
  Owner verified the SS Anubis flashback, Vela rescue, Juno departure and
  Tawfret introduction; unsupported scripts remain ineligible.
- Retain the Modern controller camera angle during ledge grabs, climbs and
  high-drop landing recovery, extending the existing mouse corrections.
  Automated checks and owner verification passed (#30).
- Preserve Modern view identity while neutralizing input during focus loss.
  The earlier correction passed owner testing. A follow-up initializes the new
  room camera while the map has focus, avoiding delayed takeover on clicking
  back. Controller/mouse regression checks and owner verification passed.
- Correct rain and software-drawn reticles disappearing during normal high-refresh
  Play because required output-frame timestamps depended on diagnostic logging.
  Regression checks pass with logging disabled; owner verified both effects.
- Keep removed controllers unassigned instead of automatically moving them to
  later player slots. Automated mapping/UI checks and owner review passed.
- Correct the fog gradient on large sky polygons, bringing Tawfret's sky and haze
  closer to matched original-game rendering. Preserve the gamma correction and
  fog percentage controls. Original-task comparisons and owner review passed.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-10-19

- Improve ship, village and Vela-rescue cutscene presentation and boss motion.
  Reduce redundant draw matching, upload allocation work, synchronous settings
  reads and live-map serialization stalls. Preserve the original game timing.
- Retain high-resolution scene images and interpolation through native blur
  effects. Add Off / Reduced / Original blur; Reduced is the default.
- Fix breakable-glass shaking and boss animation stepping during camera sweeps.
  Keep cutscene framing aligned with the game's saved widescreen option.
- Improve camera-relative interpolation of detached drone bodies and death
  animations with intentionally hidden bones.
- Preserve the mouse camera angle after high landings and ledge climbs.
  Restore the measured native standing-aim forward/strafe/diagonal speeds.
- Add Game > Settings > Change directory for portable saves, settings and
  imported ROM storage. Paths inside the game folder remain valid when it moves.
- Refresh Video Settings with tabs and add live fog strength from 0% to 100%.
  Update native window title bars to follow the Windows dark appearance.
- Let the exit-warp mod enter the next room regardless of progression gates.
  Add Map > Settings > Mods > Give all weapons as a one-click inventory/ammo grant.
- Retain the v1.2.1 boss-controls and source-scene FPS counter corrections.

Owner route and targeted visual review are complete; exact seeded parity is not
claimed. See the [release qualification](docs/development/releases-1.3.0-qualification.md)
for validation evidence and limits.
Reporter-specific reticle/hut behavior and the exact invasion-replay report
await v1.3 retests; see [known issues](docs/known-issues.md).

## 1.2.1 - 2026-10-18

- Fixed modern boss controls losing movement, strafing and separate mouse/controller aiming. Playable boss combat and jumps now retain their configured actions; actual cutscene, pause and death ownership remain intact. Owner playtests passed Vela/Ichor, Juno and Lupus.
- Fixed map exit warps stopping at a door: eligible warps now enter the next room through the native transition, preserving progression requirements.
- Corrected the scene FPS counter counting a second full-screen blur pass at the same source tick. Output FPS is still measured separately.
- Cutscene/boss motion-blur resolution loss, presentation stalls and the earlier long-route audio underruns remain open for 1.3. The controls hotfix includes no experimental rendering changes. See [the 1.3 follow-up](https://github.com/TK22-26/JetForceGemini-Recomp/issues/21).

## 1.2.0 - 2026-10-16

- Added smooth high-refresh rendering with VSync, Custom FPS and Unlimited in
  native Video Settings. Game timing remains independent of presentation rate.
  Character, camera, scenery, pickup and bridge interpolation are improved.
- Reduced combat CPU work and renderer cache stalls; improved audio delivery and
  ROM sample loading. Owner playtesting reports stable gameplay. Unlimited pacing,
  exhaustive no-dip coverage and the reported Goldwood exit-cutscene audio hitch
  remain under investigation; a high output counter is not a game-update guarantee.
- Added the full Modern Controls editor, mouse look and dual-stick aiming, shared
  action bindings, visible menu/dialogue bindings and independent inversion settings.
  Corrected crouch mouse inversion, shuriken reticle loss and resting shuriken jitter.
- Fixed the experimental keyboard/mouse startup crash by initializing game memory
  before controller discovery. The v1.1.0 crash is reproduced with keyboard selected.
- Made native execution-probe declarations and volume-file reads portable to GCC.
- Improved legacy Windows source setup: detect disabled firmware virtualization,
  refresh old WSL distribution support, and distinguish installer failures from
  actual restart requests. Normal ZIP installation still requires no build tools.
- Added an amber update banner below Play when GitHub has a newer stable release.
  **What's new** opens the project page; **Update now** opens the release/download
  page. Checks run in the background and never install updates automatically.

Extract the complete Windows x64 ZIP into a new folder. Existing saves and settings
remain in your profile. Modern gameplay and high-refresh rendering remain opt-in.
See [known issues](docs/known-issues.md) for compatibility and qualification limits.

- Added background stable-release checks, a persistent home-screen update notice,
  and **Help > Check for updatesâ€¦** with installed/latest versions and a release link.
  Offline checks leave gameplay available; downloads are never installed automatically.
- Refreshed the README and rebuilt the project dashboard around the fully playable
  v1 game, with modern-controls highlights, AI assistance credit and a startup image.

## 1.1.0 â€” 2026-10-09

- Fixed the embedded game's aspect ratio. Gameplay stays in a centered 4:3
  display area when the launcher is wide, resized, maximized, or fullscreen.
  Cutscenes retain their own top and bottom bars instead of expanding across
  the launcher window. The original game's graphics and widescreen option
  are unchanged.
- Added one-time ROM import. Select a supported ROM once; the launcher verifies
  and copies it into the local game profile. Future launches use that copy,
  so the original file can be moved or deleted. Invalid imports preserve the
  previous copy. Existing valid ROM selections are imported on upgrade.
- Removed the central ROM card after a successful import. **Game > Select ROMâ€¦**
  remains available to select another file.
- Replaced the first-run local build with a prebuilt Windows x64 game bundle.
  Players no longer need Git, Python, Visual Studio Build Tools, WSL, or a
  first-run compilation. Required Microsoft runtime DLLs are included.
- Added a clear message when only software graphics are available, avoiding
  the stalled startup and excessive memory use observed in the test VM.
- Added package integrity checks, a ROM-import regression test, and viewport
  coverage for 4:3, 16:9, ultrawide, portrait, and odd-sized windows.

Download and extract the complete v1.1.0 ZIP into a new folder. Open
`JFG-Launcher.exe`, use **Select ROMâ€¦** if prompted, and click **Play**. Existing
saves and settings remain in the same profile. The ZIP contains the compiled
program and its runtime libraries; **no ROM or game assets are included**.

The simplified installation approach was inspired by the
[Zelda64Recomp team and its plug-and-play model](https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp#plug-and-play).
This is an independent implementation.

## 1.0.0 â€” 2026-10-09

Initial stable release with the unified launcher, configurable controllers,
live map and inventory, and the recorded rendering and audio fixes. The v1.0.0
installer built the game locally from the player's ROM and required developer
tools. See the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/TK22-26/JetForceGemini-Recomp/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
