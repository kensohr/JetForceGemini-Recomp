# Issue investigations and resolutions

Keep an issue record from the first reproducible report through its final verified
resolution. This is the persistent engineering history for bugs, regressions and
significant limitations. It complements [known issues](../../known-issues.md), the
[runtime fix log](../boot-gameplay-fix.md), and feature implementation notes; link
those sources rather than copying conflicting accounts.

## Recording policy

- Start or update a record while investigating, not only after success. Use the
  [template](template.md). Give the issue a stable descriptive filename and ID.
- Record symptoms and reproduction, affected version/profile/platform, severity,
  evidence provenance, observed facts, hypotheses, attempts and their results.
- Retain failed or inconclusive attempts when they explain a decision. Correct
  invalid evidence explicitly; do not silently promote a hypothesis to a cause.
- Record the actual final code/behavior change, why it fixes the demonstrated
  cause, regression checks, remaining gaps, and where it is available. A patch,
  successful build, or completed replay alone is not a verified resolution.
- Separate **reported**, **reproduced**, **candidate**, **verified in tests**,
  **awaiting live verification**, and **resolved/released**. State the specific
  scope of a pass. Record a commit/release only once one actually exists.
- Keep public records free of ROMs, generated game code, personal save data and
  identifying machine paths. Reference private artifact IDs and hashes as needed.
- Preserve useful findings from older feature/fix logs through links. Historical
  tests apply to their recorded build, not automatically to the current tree.

This practice applies to future work throughout the repository, including
launcher/UI, controls, runtime, rendering, audio, setup and tooling. Documentation
does not authorize reopening an exhausted investigation or reset guard budgets.

## v1.4.0 publication and issue delivery

[v1.4.0 is public](https://github.com/TK22-26/JetForceGemini-Recomp/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
All eight release jobs passed and the public downloads matched the verified package.
The owner individually approved all twelve replies before publication; #15 and
#19 were subsequently closed by explicit request without additional comments.

- Closed: #15, #19, #25, #30, #31, #33, #34, #36, #37, #38 and #39.
- Still open: #32 mouse input, #35 growing audio delay and #40 Proton startup.
  #41 remains the skip-completion optimization follow-up.
- #38 was redirected to the project matching its dump, not resolved by our code.
  Closed reports retain any unverified reporter/platform coverage in their records.
- [Comment punctuation correction](github-comment-punctuation.md) records the
  posting defect and exact-text verification; no duplicate replies were created.

[2026-10-16 GitHub release-readiness audit](github-release-readiness-20261016.md): four open reports reviewed; a full update is not yet qualified.

- [BUILD-003: Release source validation](release-source-validation.md) - candidate remediation and qualification for 1.2.0.

[1.2.1 session findings targeted for 1.3](1.2.1-session-1.3-followup.md) collects the unresolved blur, slowdown and audio evidence with the general performance backlog.

- [Boss camera sweep pop](boss-camera-sweep-pop.md): camera-aware correction component-tested and owner-verified in Boss Camera Review; completed audit confirms 140 old projected-motion rejections avoided. Isolated shared-camera fallbacks and broader performance qualification remain documented; unreleased.

- [Live frame-rate settings](live-frame-rate-settings.md): queued enhancement; FPS mode/cap/VSync currently require game restart.

[v1.3.0 release qualification](../releases-1.3.0-qualification.md) tracks the combined owner pass, source/package checks and reporter retests; publication is pending.

[v1.3 qualification and release identities](../releases-1.3.0-qualification.md)
record the combined route, clean builds and publication gates. Historical rows
retain their original evidence limits; source inclusion is not exhaustive parity.

Cutscene skip (#31): latest candidate corrects the missing native A texture and updates the SKIP lettering. Invasion completion is still owner-untested; see [the active record](optional-cutscene-skipping.md).

Cutscene skip preview6: Goldwood forest scenery qualification candidate plus smaller, centered prompt with a smooth native IA8 ring; build/component/GPU checks passed, owner approval pending.

Cutscene skip preview7: capture identifies Magnus tutorial199 as the blocked sequence, before return shot399. Candidate corrects health physics-pointer classification and admits health/ammo demonstration objects only without native players; native route and safety checks passed, owner verification pending. Final A pop removed.

Cutscene skip preview8: SS Anubis flashback type65 glowing-light classification corrected; original three-shot return validated in completion-function tests. Prompt raster alignment corrected. Owner live review pending. Forest tutorial return now confirmed in preview7 trace; visual acceptance still pending.

Owner live verification (2026-10-20): preview8 SS Anubis flashback skip and A-button/ring alignment both confirmed fixed. Owner is continuing the route. This confirms these two fixes only; other untested cutscenes remain open coverage. Not yet released.

Preview8 follow-up: owner cannot skip the Vela rescue cutscene (corrected "can" to "cant"); still playing. Exact scene, eligibility and completion cause under investigation. Preserve active session; no replacement until closed.

Owner confirmed preview8 SS Anubis flashback skip and A-button/ring alignment fixed on2026-10-20; other cutscenes remain under review, unreleased.

New preview8 reports: Vela rescue cannot skip; Juno SS Anubis fly-away cannot skip; brief white flicker on return from SS Anubis to character selection. Owner continues playing; inspect current capture, do not replace active package.

Cutscene preview9: accepted preview8 flashback/alignment retained. Juno departure candidate preserves native disabled-door semantics and flag96; 4,136 completion checks pass. Vela no-prompt input and natural departure white flash remain open with targeted capture logging; owner review pending.

Cutscene preview10: Vela rescue now owner-confirmed working. Juno departure remains open after preview9 failed; revised cinematic-door eligibility passes native checks and awaits owner review. Repeated white flash remains open with bounded transition image capture.

- [Character-selection rainbow/white flash](character-selection-depth-flash.md): workload-aware depth/readback correction passed renderer checks and owner visual review in preview13; unreleased.

Current cutscene status: owner confirmed preview13 Tawfret intro, Vela rescue and Juno departure skipping. Earlier preview notes above preserve historical failures and superseded pending states; see [the current record](optional-cutscene-skipping.md).

2026-10-20 cutscene review: [optional skipping](optional-cutscene-skipping.md) now records the owner checklist failures, separate direct-entry limitations, Quarry tribal flashing, and source-tested completion candidates. These candidates are not yet owner-verified or released. [Selector loading](cutscene-review-selector-loading.md) records the session replay and character mapping candidates.

- [Launcher file verification feedback](launcher-file-verification-feedback.md): open owner report; both Verify files actions lack a visible working state (2026-10-20).


2026-10-20 checklist completion candidate: linked texture-actor segments,
native credits exit and selector cleanup, and reachable ending departure are
source/component-tested and installed for targeted owner retest.
[File verification feedback](launcher-file-verification-feedback.md) adds
visible activity to both verification views;81 native UI checks pass.
The full owner checklist is preserved; unresolved diagnostic contexts and
Quarry tribal flashing are not marked resolved.


2026-10-20 follow-up: Quarry tribals brighten/darken after both282/0 and411/0,
including the owner's restarted Original-FPS comparison. Native EmuHawk
brightness comparison is in progress. The private selector's classified
catalog and BigShip direct-entry rejection pass isolated persistence checks
and62 native entry checks; these changes are staged, not installed/released.


Quarry follow-up: original-ROM EmuHawk also visibly pulses. The exact earlier
day/night lighting repair was located; a scoped restoration is built and
installed for owner review, with the live outcome still pending. See the
[cutscene issue](optional-cutscene-skipping.md) for cause, comparison evidence,
source scope and limitations. No released-resolution claim.

- [Quarry atmospheric day/night transition jumps](quarry-atmospheric-transitions.md): owner-approved corrected smoothing; all 12 phases captured with 2,971 matching fog commands and zero colour-match rejection. Original integer-distance steps and rejected strobing candidate documented. Unreleased; actor fix remains accepted.

- [Modern controls on P2-P4](modern-controls-secondary-players.md): confirmed setup/runtime restriction; UI tests pass, per-port runtime candidate under validation.

- 2026-10-21 review follow-up: [BigShip selector entry](cutscene-review-selector-loading.md) no longer crashes but does not start. Current validator deliberately rejects the unsafe standalone entry; safe entry and clear selector feedback remain unresolved. Not a verified skip pass.

- 2026-10-21 owner cutscene retest: [scene207](optional-cutscene-skipping.md) shows the skip prompt but reportedly crashes after skipping. High-severity completion failure remains open; prompt visibility is not successful skip verification.

- Juno final cutscene pass: [current owner retest](cutscene-owner-retest-20261020.md), All four targeted fixes are owner-confirmed. The11 remaining unchecked entries are classified as likely development/setup variants after the original631-exit and animation-script scans; no exact unresolved variant was linked by those exits. Classification limits are recorded; the type 145 audit is complete with a source-comment correction and no runtime change. [Selector record](cutscene-review-selector-loading.md) covers mode recovery, focus handoff, explicit blocked-entry feedback and the corrected note-row event ordering.
